  Title:
    How many seconds till tomorrow?

  Description:
    Create a function getSecondsToTomorrow() that returns the number of seconds till tomorrow.

    For instance, if now is 23:00, then:

    getSecondsToTomorrow() == 3600
    
    P.S. The function should work at any day, the “today” is not hardcoded.
