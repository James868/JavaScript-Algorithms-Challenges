/*
  Description:
    Given an array, create a function that shuffles (randomly reorders) elements of the array.
    Multiple runs of shuffle may lead to different orders of elements.
    All element orders should have an equal probability.
    For instance, [1,2,3] can be reordered as [1,2,3] or [1,3,2] or [3,1,2] etc, with equal probability of each case.
    
  Note:
    The original array shouldn't be modified, instead clone it.

  Examples:
    console.log(shuffleArray([1, 2, 3]));
    // -> [3, 2, 1]

    console.log(shuffleArray([1, 2, 3]));
    // -> [2, 1, 3]

    console.log(shuffleArray([1, 2, 3]));
    // -> [3, 1, 2]
*/

function shuffleArray(array) {

}

module.exports = shuffleArray;
