/*
  Description:
    Create a function that gets the number of seconds from the beginning of today.
    The function should work in any day. That is, it should not have a hard-coded value of “today”.

  Example:
    For instance, if now 10:00 am, and there was no daylight savings shift, then: 
    
    console.log(getSecondsToday());
    // -> 36000 // (3600 * 10)
*/

function getSecondsToday() {

}

module.exports = getSecondsToday;
