  Title:
    Get average age

  Description:
    Write the function getAverageAge(users) that gets an array of objects with    property age and gets the average.
    The formula for the average is (age1 + age2 + ... + ageN) / N.

  Examples:
    const john = { name: "John", age: 25 };
    const pete = { name: "Pete", age: 30 };
    const mary = { name: "Mary", age: 29 };

    const users = [ john, pete, mary ];

    console.log(getAverageAge(users)); 
    // -> (25 + 30 + 29) / 3 = 28
