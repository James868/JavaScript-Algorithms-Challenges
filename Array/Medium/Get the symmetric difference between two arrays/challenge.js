  Title:
    Get the symmetric difference between two arrays

  Description:
    Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two given arrays, but not both.
    In other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.

    Note: You can return the array with its elements in any order.

  Example:
    console.log(getDiffBetweenArrays([1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])); 
    // -> [4, 6]

    console.log(getDiffBetweenArrays([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])); 
    // -> []

    console.log(getDiffBetweenArrays(["John", "Bonny"], ["John", "Bonny", "Frank"])); 
    // -> ["Frank"]
