  Title:
    Chunky Monkey

  Description:
    Write a function that splits an array (first argument) into groups the length of size (second argument) 
    and returns them as a two-dimensional array.

  Examples:
    console.log(chunkArrayInGroups(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2)); 
    // -> [["a", "b"], ["c", "d"]]

    console.log(chunkArrayInGroups([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 4)); 
    // -> [[0, 1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
