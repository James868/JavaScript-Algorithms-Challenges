<h1 align="center">JavaScript Challenges</h1>
<p align="center">
  <em>A collection of JavaScript challenges to train your skill</em>
</p>

The challenges are divided into 5 sections (array, date, math, object and string) 
and 3 difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard).

I really hope this repository can help a lot of people who wish to improve their JavaScript skill.

All of this challenges came from: 
- <a href="https://www.codewars.com">Codewars</a>
- <a href="https://javascript.info/">javascript.info</a>
- <a href="https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/">w3resource</a>
