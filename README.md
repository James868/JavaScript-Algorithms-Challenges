## Description

A collection of JavaScript challenges that are divided into 5 sections (array, date, math, object and string) 
and 3 difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard).
All challenges are taken from multiple resources or created by me.
I hope this project can help a lot of people who want to improve their JavaScript skill.
