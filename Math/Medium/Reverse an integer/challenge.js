  Title:
    Reverse an integer

  Description:
    Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
    Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1].
    For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

  Examples:
    console.log(reverseInt(-123));
    // -> -321

    console.log(reverseInt(240.6));
    // -> 240.6 is not an integer
